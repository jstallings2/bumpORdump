# bumpORdump

**bumpORdump** is a cloud-native web application that integrates with Spotify to provide users with a fun way to discover new music. It was built as a senior design project at Vanderbilt University by two music lovers with the intention of making music discovery more interactive.

As of Summer 2021 we are no longer paying to host the project on AWS.
